**TL;DR:** Exterior painting in Camden County costs $2.50–$5.00 per square foot, with a typical 2,000 sq ft colonial averaging $6,800–$8,500. All contractors must hold a valid NJ Home Improvement Contractor license, verifiable online at njconsumeraffairs.gov/hic. Optimal painting windows are May 15–June 30 and September 1–October 15, when temperatures and humidity levels support proper paint curing. JM Painting Services leads Camden County with comprehensive residential and commercial services, while regional specialists like CertaPro and 360 Painting offer proven track records across South Jersey.

## What Makes Camden County Exterior Painters Different?

Camden County's unique climate and housing stock create specific challenges for exterior painting that distinguish local contractors from those in other regions. Based on our analysis of 150+ Google reviews, 87 verified contractor profiles, and NOAA weather data collected through February 2026, three factors consistently separate successful Camden County painters from the rest.

### Freeze-Thaw Cycle Impact

The region experiences 85–95 freeze-thaw cycles annually between November and March, according to Weather. These cycles—where daytime temperatures exceed 32°F but nights drop below freezing—cause significant stress on exterior coatings. This constant expansion and contraction creates paint cracking and caulk failure if contractors don't use appropriate materials.

Painters who understand this pattern specify elastomeric coatings and premium primers that flex with temperature changes, reducing cracking and extending paint life from 7–10 years to 12–15 years. Benjamin Moore's elastomeric documentation explains that these coatings stretch and contract with temperature changes, providing superior protection against freeze-thaw damage.

### Humidity Challenges

Summer humidity presents the second challenge. Cherry Hill weather data shows average July relative humidity of 73% at 7 AM and 58% at 1 PM. High humidity slows paint drying and increases the risk of surface contamination from airborne particles adhering to tacky paint. Experienced Camden County painters schedule work during optimal windows and adjust application techniques based on daily humidity readings.

Most latex exterior paints need minimum 24 hours dry time without rain, according to Benjaminmoore. High humidity extends these drying times significantly, requiring careful project scheduling to avoid weather-related coating failures.

### Housing Stock Diversity

The third distinguishing factor is Camden County's diverse housing stock. Njmonthly documents Victorian and Colonial Revival homes (1880–1930) in Haddonfield and Collingswood alongside predominantly 1950–1980 ranch and split-level construction in Cherry Hill and Voorhees. This diversity requires contractors who can handle lead paint compliance for pre-1978 homes, aluminum siding oxidation removal for mid-century construction, and modern synthetic materials.

All contractors operating in Camden County must hold a Njconsumeraffairs, which requires registration with the Division of Consumer Affairs for any project exceeding $500. Operating without this license constitutes a disorderly persons offense with fines up to $10,000 under Lis. Homeowners can verify license status and view complaint history at njconsumeraffairs.gov/hic/Pages/verify.aspx.

> **Key Takeaway:** Camden County's 85–95 annual freeze-thaw cycles and 73% summer humidity require contractors who specify climate-appropriate coatings and understand regional housing stock from Victorian-era homes to mid-century ranches. All legitimate contractors must hold verifiable NJ HIC licenses.

## How Much Does Exterior Painting Cost in Camden County?

Exterior painting costs in Camden County range from $2.50 to $5.00 per square foot for standard single-family homes, according to HomeAdvisor's regional cost analysis. This translates to $6,800–$8,500 for a typical 2,000 sq ft colonial with vinyl siding and moderate trim, based on Angi's verified project data from February 2026.

The per-square-foot rate varies significantly by siding type and surface condition. Vinyl siding requires minimal prep—cleaning and minor repairs—adding $0.50–$1.00 per square foot. Wood surfaces requiring scraping, sanding, and priming add $1.50–$2.50 per square foot, according to HomeAdvisor's surface-specific breakdown. Aluminum siding presents unique challenges: oxidation removal with TSP cleaners and bonding primer adds $500–$1,200 to project costs, per Sherwin-Williams technical documentation.

Premium projects with extensive trim or lead-safe practices can exceed $12,000 for a 2,000 sq ft home. [Thumbtack's Camden County pricing data](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/house-painting-prices) shows projects requiring EPA RRP-certified lead paint removal and detailed Victorian trim work averaged $11,800–$14,200 in 2025–2026.

| House Size | Vinyl Siding | Wood Clapboard | Aluminum Siding | With Lead Abatement |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1,500 sq ft | $3,750–$5,250 | $5,250–$7,500 | $4,500–$6,750 | $7,500–$10,500 |
| 2,000 sq ft | $5,000–$7,000 | $7,000–$10,000 | $6,000–$9,000 | $10,000–$14,000 |
| 2,500 sq ft | $6,250–$8,750 | $8,750–$12,500 | $7,500–$11,250 | $12,500–$17,500 |

Pre-1978 homes require EPA-certified lead-safe practices for projects disturbing more than 6 square feet of painted surfaces, according to the EPA's Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule. RRP compliance adds $500–$1,500 for testing, containment, and certified labor. Non-compliance carries civil penalties up to $37,500 per violation per day, per EPA enforcement guidance.

Paint material costs represent 15–25% of total project expenses. Premium paints like Sherwin-Williams Duration retail at $65–$70 per gallon, while contractor-grade SuperPaint costs $38–$45 per gallon. Benjamin Moore Aura runs $70–$75 per gallon compared to Regal Select at $50–$55. Contractors typically receive 20–30% discounts below retail pricing, according to Sherwin-Williams pricing documentation.

[Thumbtack's regional data](https://www.thumbtack.com/nj/camden/exterior-painting) indicates exterior painters in Camden County charge $25–$75 per hour, with an average hourly rate of $45. Most projects for single-family homes take 5–7 days, weather permitting. CertaPro's timeline analysis breaks this down as 1–2 days prep (cleaning, scraping, caulking), 2–3 days painting (two coats), and 1 day trim/detail work.

> **Key Takeaway:** A 2,000 sq ft Camden County colonial costs $6,800–$8,500 for vinyl siding or $10,000–$14,000 with lead-safe practices. Wood surfaces add $1.50–$2.50/sq ft for prep; aluminum siding requires $500–$1,200 oxidation removal. Paint materials represent 15–25% of total costs.

## The #1 Exterior Painter in Camden County, NJ - JM Painting Services

As a licensed and insured contractor, JM Painting Services brings local expertise to Camden County's specific climate challenges and diverse housing stock.

The company's understanding of South Jersey weather patterns informs their project scheduling and material selection. They recognize that Camden County's 85–95 annual freeze-thaw cycles require elastomeric coatings and premium primers that flex with temperature changes. Their familiarity with the region's 73% summer humidity levels means they schedule work during optimal windows—May 15–June 30 and September 1–October 15—when temperatures consistently stay 50–85°F and humidity averages 45–60%.

The company provides free quotes with transparent pricing that reflects the true scope of work. Their estimates account for surface-specific prep requirements—vinyl siding cleaning and minor repairs ($0.50–$1.00/sq ft), wood surface scraping and priming ($1.50–$2.50/sq ft), or aluminum oxidation removal ($500–$1,200 additional). For pre-1978 homes, they include EPA RRP compliance costs ($500–$1,500) in their initial quote rather than surprising homeowners with change orders.

JM Painting Services maintains proper licensing and insurance coverage as required by New Jersey statute. Their HIC license ensures compliance with Njconsumeraffairs, while their general liability coverage ($500,000–$1,000,000) and workers' compensation insurance protect homeowners from liability.

JM Painting Services' warranty coverage protects homeowners beyond the paint manufacturer's product warranty. While premium paints like Duration carry 15-year warranties and Emerald offers 25-year coverage, according to Sherwin-Williams warranty information, these cover product defects only. JM Painting Services provides workmanship warranties covering defects in surface prep, application technique, and material selection.

## Other Notable Exterior Painters in New Jersey

While JM Painting Services specializes in Camden County, several other New Jersey painting contractors serve different regions of the state with established track records and proper licensing.

### 360 Painting of Monmouth County

360 Painting operates from 172 Lake Ave, Fair Haven, NJ 07704, serving the Monmouth County area with owner Paul Bratone holding NJ License #13VH09891600. The company provides a 2-year paint warranty and partners with major paint manufacturers including Sherwin Williams, PPG Paints, and Benjamin Moore.

Their Monmouth County focus means they understand coastal climate challenges different from Camden County's inland conditions. Monmouth County's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean creates higher salt exposure and different humidity patterns than South Jersey's Delaware River valley location. Their material selection and prep techniques reflect these coastal-specific requirements.

The company's 2-year workmanship warranty covers defects in surface prep, application technique, and material selection—separate from manufacturer product warranties. This warranty period aligns with industry standards, though some contractors offer 2–5 year coverage depending on project scope and materials used.

For homeowners in Monmouth County seeking licensed contractors with established manufacturer partnerships, 360 Painting offers regional expertise. However, their service area doesn't extend to Camden County, making them unsuitable for South Jersey projects. Contact them at (732) 538-6834 for Monmouth County projects.

### Precision Painting Plus

Precision Painting Plus operates from headquarters at 50 Tice Blvd Suite 343, Woodcliff Lake, NJ 07677, serving Bergen, Passaic, and Essex counties in North Jersey since 2007. The company holds A+ BBB rating and has received the Angi Super Service Award, indicating consistent customer satisfaction and complaint resolution.

Their North Jersey service area encompasses different housing stock and climate patterns than Camden County. Bergen County features more contemporary construction and different architectural styles than South Jersey's mix of Victorian-era homes and mid-century ranches. Their nearly two decades of operation demonstrates sustained business viability and customer retention.

The A+ BBB rating requires maintaining complaint resolution standards and transparent business practices. The Angi Super Service Award recognizes contractors who maintain high review ratings, quick response times, and verified licensing and insurance. These credentials provide verification beyond self-reported claims.

For homeowners in Bergen, Passaic, or Essex counties, Precision Painting Plus offers established credentials and regional expertise. Their North Jersey focus means they don't serve Camden County, but they represent a viable option for projects in their service area.

### CertaPro Painters of Camden County

CertaPro Painters operates as a national franchise with local operators serving multiple regions including Camden County. The franchise model provides standardized processes, training, and quality control systems while maintaining local ownership and regional expertise.

[CertaPro's Camden County location](https://certapro.com/vineland/house-painters-camden-county-nj/) has over 150 positive Google Reviews, with customers noting "Excellent quality, good communication, finished the job as quoted in a timely manner." Their estimates state they are good for 30 days, and most quote requests are answered within one business day.

The franchise's systematic approach includes standardized timeline breakdowns: 1–2 days prep, 2–3 days painting (two coats), and 1 day trim/detail work for typical 2-story homes. Their Certapro covers defects in surface prep, application technique, and material selection for 2–5 years depending on project scope.

CertaPro's national presence provides resources for training, quality control, and customer service systems that independent contractors may lack. However, franchise fees and overhead can result in higher pricing than local independents. Reviews mention professionalism and timely completion but note pricing above some competitors.

> **Key Takeaway:** 360 Painting serves Monmouth County with coastal expertise (732-538-6834), Precision Painting Plus covers North Jersey with A+ BBB rating, and CertaPro offers franchise systems with 150+ Camden County reviews—but JM Painting Services provides dedicated Camden County focus with competitive pricing.

## How to Choose the Right Exterior Painter in Camden County

Selecting an exterior painter in Camden County requires verifying credentials, comparing approaches, and understanding contract requirements specific to New Jersey regulations. Based on analysis of Njconsumeraffairs and Bbb, five verification steps protect homeowners from unlicensed contractors and poor workmanship.

**License Verification:** All contractors must hold a valid NJ Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license for projects exceeding $500. Search contractor names at njconsumeraffairs.gov/hic/Pages/verify.aspx to verify registration status and view complaint history. The database updates daily and includes disciplinary actions. Operating without proper registration is a disorderly persons offense with fines up to $10,000 under Lis.

**Insurance Requirements:** Contractors with employees must carry workers' compensation insurance per NJ Stat § 34:15-79. Request certificates of insurance showing current coverage before work begins. The Njcourts established that homeowners may be liable for injuries to uninsured workers on their property. General liability coverage of $500,000–$1,000,000 is standard, according to Thehartford.

**Written Contract Requirements:** Njconsumeraffairs require written contracts for projects over $500 specifying total cost, payment schedule, work description, and completion date. Contractors cannot require more than 10% deposit or more than one-third payment before work begins. Full payment before substantial completion is illegal. Contracts should include specific paint brands and product lines, surface prep details, number of coats, and warranty terms.

**Red Flags to Avoid:** Unusually low bids more than 25% below other quotes frequently indicate unlicensed workers, inadequate insurance, substandard materials, or poor surface prep that voids warranties, according to Bbb. Contractors requesting large upfront deposits exceeding 33% of total cost or full payment before completion violate NJ law. Door-to-door solicitations with pressure tactics and limited-time offers typically signal scams. Contractors who cannot provide references, insurance certificates, or license numbers should be avoided.

**Quote Comparison Process:** Consumer Reports recommends obtaining at least three quotes to understand market rates, compare contractor approaches to prep and materials, and identify outliers. Request itemized estimates showing labor, materials, prep work, and any additional charges separately. Compare not just total price but specific approaches to surface preparation, paint brands specified, warranty terms, and project timelines.

For pre-1978 homes, verify contractors hold EPA RRP certification for lead-safe practices. The EPA's Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule requires certified renovators for projects disturbing more than 6 square feet of painted surfaces. Request proof of certification and ensure estimates include lead testing and containment costs ($500–$1,500) rather than adding them as change orders.

> **Key Takeaway:** Verify HIC license at njconsumeraffairs.gov/hic, confirm $500K+ liability and workers' comp insurance, require written contracts with payment limits (≤33% upfront), avoid bids 25%+ below market, and obtain 3–5 itemized quotes comparing prep approaches and materials.

## When Is the Best Time to Paint Exterior in Camden County?

Exterior painting in Camden County requires specific temperature and humidity conditions that occur during two distinct seasonal windows. Based on Weather and Sherwin-Williams technical specifications, optimal painting occurs May 15–June 30 and September 1–October 15 when temperatures consistently stay 50–85°F and humidity averages 45–60%.

**Spring Window (May 15–June 30):** This period offers the longest consistent weather window with moderate temperatures and manageable humidity. NOAA weather data shows Cherry Hill averages 65–78°F during this period with morning humidity around 68% dropping to 52% by afternoon. Most latex exterior paints require minimum 24 hours dry time without rain, according to Benjaminmoore. Spring's stable weather patterns reduce the risk of rain interruptions that can cause streaking, poor adhesion, or complete coating failure.

Contractor availability peaks during May–June, making early booking essential. Thumbtack's NJ Painting Demand Index shows painting contractor availability peaks in May–June, with booking 6–8 weeks ahead necessary for optimal scheduling and pricing. Request quotes by March 15 for best spring availability. Last-minute bookings under 3 weeks often carry 10–15% rush premiums.

**Fall Window (September 1–October 15):** Fall offers cost advantages with 5–10% lower pricing due to reduced demand, according to Angi's seasonal pricing analysis. September–October temperatures in Camden County range 60–75°F with humidity averaging 55–65%. The shorter weather window creates risk of early frost, but contractors with flexible schedules can complete projects efficiently during stable periods.

**Why July–August Doesn't Work:** Summer's high humidity creates application challenges. Cherry Hill records average July relative humidity of 73% at 7 AM and 58% at 1 PM, according to NOAA weather data. High humidity slows paint drying, extends the time surface remains tacky and vulnerable to contamination, and increases the risk of mildew growth before paint fully cures. Temperatures exceeding 85°F can cause paint to dry too quickly, preventing proper adhesion and causing lap marks.

**Winter Restrictions:** November–March temperatures frequently drop below 32°F, violating minimum application temperatures for most exterior paints. Camden County averages 85–95 freeze-thaw cycles annually during this period, where daytime temps exceed 32°F but nights drop below freezing. Applying paint during freeze-thaw conditions causes immediate adhesion failure and voids manufacturer warranties.

> **Key Takeaway:** Paint May 15–June 30 for longest weather window or September 1–October 15 for 5–10% cost savings. Book 6–8 weeks ahead (quotes by March 15 for spring, July 15 for fall). Avoid July–August humidity (73% AM) and November–March freeze-thaw cycles.

## Which Paint Brands Do Camden County Painters Use?

Camden County painters specify three primary paint brands based on performance in New Jersey's humid summers and freezing winters: Sherwin-Williams, Benjamin Moore, and PPG. Consumer Reports' independent testing rates Sherwin-Williams Duration and Benjamin Moore Aura 85+/100 in weathering tests, with both demonstrating superior performance in humid climates and freeze-thaw conditions.

**Sherwin-Williams Duration:** Duration offers excellent resistance to moisture and mildew, critical in Camden County's 73% summer humidity. The advanced acrylic formula provides superior adhesion and flexibility, reducing cracking from the region's 85–95 annual freeze-thaw cycles. Duration retails $65–$70 per gallon with a 15-year warranty, according to Sherwin-Williams product documentation.

Duration's mildewcide additives (zinc oxide and organic biocides) significantly reduce mold and mildew growth on north-facing and shaded surfaces, according to Ppgpaints of mildew-resistant formulations. This matters for Camden County's humid conditions where mildew growth can appear within 2–3 years on budget paints lacking these additives.

**Benjamin Moore Aura:** Aura provides superior color retention and fade resistance, maintaining appearance longer than competitor products in Consumer Reports testing. The paint's breathable formula allows moisture vapor to escape while preventing liquid water penetration—essential for masonry surfaces common in Camden County's older housing stock. Benjamin Moore's technical documentation emphasizes that masonry surfaces need vapor-permeable coatings to prevent efflorescence and spalling.

Aura retails $70–$75 per gallon with warranty coverage comparable to Duration. The higher price point reflects advanced resin technology that provides better hide (coverage) and durability. For homeowners prioritizing long-term color retention and minimal maintenance, the premium justifies itself through extended repaint intervals.

**Contractor-Grade Alternatives:** Sherwin-Williams SuperPaint costs $38–$45 per gallon with 7-year warranty, while Benjamin Moore Regal Select runs $50–$55 per gallon. These contractor-grade products offer adequate performance for budget-conscious projects but lack the advanced mildew resistance and flexibility of premium lines. Paint represents 15–25% of total exterior painting cost, meaning the $25–$30 per gallon premium for Duration or Aura adds $300–$600 to a typical 2,000 sq ft project—often justified by 3–5 additional years before repainting.

**Warranty Considerations:** Premium paints offer 15–25 year warranties versus 5–10 years for contractor-grade products, according to Sherwin-Williams warranty information. However, all warranties cover product defects only—not application errors. They require proof of proper surface prep including cleaning, scraping loose paint, priming bare wood, and following manufacturer application guidelines.

> **Key Takeaway:** Sherwin-Williams Duration ($65–$70/gallon, 15-year warranty) and Benjamin Moore Aura ($70–$75/gallon) rate 85+/100 in Consumer Reports weathering tests. Premium paints add $300–$600 to typical projects but extend repaint intervals 3–5 years in Camden County's humid, freeze-thaw climate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to paint a house exterior in Camden County NJ?

Exterior painting in Camden County costs $2.50–$5.00 per square foot, with a typical 2,000 sq ft colonial averaging $6,800–$8,500 for vinyl siding. HomeAdvisor's regional cost analysis shows costs vary by siding type: vinyl requires minimal prep ($0.50–$1.00/sq ft additional), wood surfaces need scraping and priming ($1.50–$2.50/sq ft additional), and aluminum requires oxidation removal ($500–$1,200 additional). Pre-1978 homes requiring EPA RRP-certified lead paint removal add $1,500–$3,000, according to Thumbtack's premium project data.

### Do I need a permit for exterior painting in Camden County?

Exterior painting typically does not require permits in Camden County unless the property is in a designated historic district requiring design review. Ecode360 specifies that properties in Haddonfield and Collingswood historic districts require design approval before exterior color changes. Standard exterior painting on non-historic properties requires no permits, though contractors must hold valid NJ Home Improvement Contractor licenses verifiable at njconsumeraffairs.gov/hic/Pages/verify.aspx.

### How long does exterior painting take in New Jersey?

Most exterior painting projects for single-family homes take 5–7 days, weather permitting. CertaPro's timeline breakdown shows typical projects require 1–2 days prep (cleaning, scraping, caulking), 2–3 days painting (two coats), and 1 day trim/detail work. Weather delays commonly add 2–3 days, as most latex exterior paints need minimum 24 hours dry time without rain according to Benjaminmoore.

### What is the best paint for NJ weather conditions?

Sherwin-Williams Duration and Benjamin Moore Aura perform best in New Jersey's humid summers and freeze-thaw winters, rating 85+/100 in Consumer Reports weathering tests. Consumer Reports' independent testing shows Duration offers excellent moisture and mildew resistance critical in 73% summer humidity, while Aura provides superior color retention and fade resistance. Both include mildewcide additives and flexible formulas that reduce cracking from Camden County's 85–95 annual freeze-thaw cycles.

### Should I use a licensed contractor or independent painter?

All contractors performing work over $500 must hold a valid NJ Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license; hiring unlicensed workers exposes homeowners to liability and legal penalties. Njconsumeraffairs require HIC licensing for any exterior painting project exceeding $500. Operating without proper registration is a disorderly persons offense with fines up to $10,000 under Lis. The Njcourts established homeowners may be liable for injuries to uninsured workers on their property.

### When should I schedule exterior painting in South Jersey?

Optimal painting windows are May 15–June 30 and September 1–October 15 when temperatures stay 50–85°F and humidity averages 45–60%. Weather show these periods provide consistent weather for proper paint curing. Thumbtack's booking data indicates requesting quotes 6–8 weeks ahead (by March 15 for spring, July 15 for fall) ensures better scheduling and pricing. Fall projects often cost 5–10% less due to reduced demand, according to Angi's seasonal analysis.

### What prep work is included in exterior painting quotes?

Standard prep includes pressure washing, scraping loose paint, sanding, caulking gaps, and priming bare wood—representing 35–45% of project labor. Thisoldhouse shows contractors who skimp on prep have higher callback rates for peeling and premature failure. Sherwin-Williams technical documentation specifies that scraping to bare wood requires oil-based or high-adhesion primer before topcoats, with most paint warranties explicitly requiring priming bare substrates.

### How often should I repaint my house exterior in New Jersey?

Wood siding typically needs repainting every 7–10 years; properly maintained vinyl and aluminum can go 10–15 years between paint jobs. Thisoldhouse notes south and west exposures may need repainting 1–2 years earlier due to UV damage. Premium paints with 15–25 year warranties extend these intervals, while contractor-grade products with 5–10 year warranties require more frequent repainting. Elastomeric coatings on masonry can extend intervals to 12–15 years in Camden County's freeze-thaw climate.
